##Project:
In this project, a user is taken to a Bank login website (Sabik's Bank), where the user has two options, sign up or sign in, if the user does not have an account, he will choose sign up. The user is then taken to a sign up page, where its asked for centain information, this information is store using hibernate and http/Servlet (tomcat) into a database using MySQL. Once the account has been created, the user is taken to the home page, and is now able to log in with his new credentials. If the credentials match the information in the database, then the user is taken to a page (Successful.html), where it gets a message saying it has sucessfully log in. If the password or username is wrong, he gets a message as well.
